## Description

This project is designed to centralize and clean data from a multinational retail dataset. It focuses on the following key areas:

- **Data Extraction**: Extracts data from various sources including PDFs and databases.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and preprocesses data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This includes handling missing values, correcting data types, and managing foreign key constraints.
- **Data Integration**: Merges and integrates data from different tables to create a comprehensive dataset suitable for analysis.

### Aims

- Centralize data from multiple sources into a unified format.
- Clean and preprocess data to ensure high quality and consistency.
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis and reporting.

### What I Learned

- How to handle and clean large datasets from various sources.
- Techniques for data type conversion and handling inconsistencies in data.
- Implementation of data integrity checks and foreign key constraints in SQL.
